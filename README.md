# Task-Manager-API

A RESTful Task-Manager-API created for testing various NodeJS functionalities and npm modules.

Works with MongoDB, has CRUD for Users and Tasks, user authentication, avatar uploads, 
automatic e-mail sending on creating/deleting user accounts

##TODO

Unit tests, perhaps a user interface with React in future.
